It is the long coats and berets that float the avenues, the daring motorcyclists that weave between even bolder drivers, the black trash bags piled high up to your chest aside bright green bins.

It is a monarch of a river, not in size, but in history, magnifying and magnified by the city around it. The waters of the Seine are dark and brackish, never still, determined and steady on its path to the Channel. In millennia past, it must have been a cradle of life, sourcing the heartwater that nurtured tribes, city states, and nations. In recent centuries, it has been polluted and spoiled, its fauna and flora dwindling as it became ever more inhospitable. We have only recently begun to reclaim its lost dignity.

They are constants in the torrent of life that flows around them, washes over them. We sit as they do, sipping on spritzes in the early afternoon.

Even along the smallest side streets, one can find luxury stores selling a variety of boutique goods.

Our seven-day whirlwind tour took us from the Eiffel Tower to the Arc du Triomphe, from Le Jardin de Tuileries to Le Jardin de Luxembourg, from La Basilique Du Sacre-Coeur to Le Palais de Versailles. We dined throughout the city, exploring tastes and culture alike. The museums were incredible. Le Musée Rodin, Le Musée D’Orsay, and the Louvre have all stolen my heart, and I am eager to return, to slow down and take it all in with fresh eyes. Some of my favorite memories were caught in moments of liminality. Two ducks asleep aside a rustling fountain. A warmly-lit alleyway after a bout of rain.

By then, the lights had just turned off, the tower’s trusses a dark silhouette against the night sky. As we stood on the bridge, I remember feeling a bittersweet mix of emotion. Bitter, that I was to leave come dawn. Sweet, that we were able to make so many beautiful memories together."}]
