2b:T446,The high stellarch of a distant, techno-feudal aristocracy reaches out to the colonists. Trials and challenges are sent their way, and our colonists persevere for Chris to be awarded higher and higher noble titles. He becomes first a freeholder, then a yeoman, then a knight, a praetor, a baron. He is rewarded with psychic powers that make him a deadly presence in the battlefield. Akira’s savvy recruiting allows the colony to swell in numbers. As Edie’s research progresses, our colonists are first armed with SMGs, then assault rifles, then charge rifles. Akira names the colony Highgarden, and our heroes becomes well-known all across the rimworld. From time to time, tragedies befall the colony. Levin, a miner, is shot through the chest by a mechanoid lancer, instantly vaporizing his heart. Sid, a barkeep, catches a stray bullet to his head, mangling his brain and rendering him vegetative. Our colonists mourn and bury the fallen, but their work continues. They strategically attack pirate outposts, raid ancient tombs, and trade with nearby factions.
