13:["$","p","p-16",{"children":"If there’s one thing vibes-based brewers and science-based brewers can agree on, it’s that proper sanitation is the most critical step of brewing, regardless of what you make. Contamination can produce off-notes and unpleasant flavors that can ruin months of work. A little goes a long way. Brewers who don’t properly sanitize may get lucky for a while, but they’ll inevitably run into a spoiled batch."}]
14:["$","p","p-17",{"children":"Star San is a no-rinse, acid-based sanitizer that can be easily mixed with water and stored in a spray bottle. As my equipment was newly purchased, sterilizing was a matter of spraying down all surfaces and rinsing with tap water."}]
15:["$","p","p-18",{"children":"(Brewers usually advocate for using boiled water. My home water system filters out bacteria, so I felt safe enough using tap water to rinse after each sanitization step.)"}]
16:["$","p","p-19",{"children":"Assuming all your materials and ingredients are within reach (and sanitized), the first step is to hydrate your yeast. A single packet goes a long way: I brewed all four gallons with just two packets of yeast. After mixing the yeast into lukewarm water and adding in a teaspoon of yeast nutrition, I covered the yeast with saran wrap and let it sit off to the side. You could be a jerk and toss the yeast in without this step. I just thought it wise to get the party started."}]
17:["$","p","p-20",{"children":"The must is the raw mix of honey, water, and other ingredients that is consumed over the course of fermentation (think: must is to mead as wort is to beer). Making the must is fairly simple: bring half a gallon of water to around 100 degrees, then dissolve in the honey. Don’t bring the mix to a boil — doing so will break down the honey and risk losing its distinctive flavor profile — instead, just stir on low heat until the mixture is fully dissolved."}]
18:["$","p","p-21",{"children":"There is much room for experimentation at this step. My first batch was a simple mix consisting of 5 lbs of honey and water. My second batch was more adventurous, with 3 lbs of honey and 1.5 lbs of maple syrup, along with cloves and cinnamon. The first will produce a classic mead. The second will produce acerglyn, which should hopefully retain notes of maple in the end product."}]
19:["$","p","p-22",{"children":"(The quality of your honey is one of the most important factors during the mead-making process. Many brewers advocate for first-timers to start with wildflower honey and clove-infused honey, which should produce a nuttier end product)"}]
1a:["$","p","p-23",{"children":"The next step is to add in whatever fruit or herbs you intend to infuse your mead with. Adding oranges and raisins to your mix is typically recommended as an easy way to provide nitrogen for your yeast, but the consensus is mixed on whether or not it’s actually useful. Some brewers believe raisins add off-flavors to the end product."}]
1b:["$","p","p-24",{"children":"The most scientific response I found claimed that a single teaspoon of yeast nutrient had the equivalent nitrogen content of a hundred raisins. I shrugged and added raisins to both batches anyways."}]
1c:["$","p","p-25",{"children":"To infuse my first batch, I added a cup of dried elderflowers both demijohn flasks. For my second, I added half an orange each (with their peels). Then, I poured the must in, which filled the demijohns halfway full. I added the hydrated yeast, then topped them off with distilled water, leaving around three inches of air. I capped the flask, shook the mixture to aerate the yeast, then topped each flask off with a three-piece airlock."}]
1d:["$","p","p-26",{"children":"And that was that. I hauled the flasks down to my basement and left the yeast to begin their magic. From here, the rest is waiting."}]

1f:["$","p","p-28",{"children":"It has been over a week since both batches were prepared. All four gallons are happily fermenting away in my basement. It is around 70 degrees and dark in the room the flasks are kept. Unlike in beer brewing, light won’t ruin the batch, but it’s still generally preferred to keep yeast in darkness."}]
20:["$","p","p-29",{"children":"Primary fermentation takes around 2-3 weeks. Secondary fermentation can last up to a year. You can start drinking the mead after three months, but like wine, the flavors develop and age over time."}]
21:["$","p","p-30",{"children":"Brewers tend to have strong opinions about best practices at this stage."}]
22:["$","p","p-31",{"children":"Some brewers advocate for daily aeration during the first few days of primary fermentation. The idea here is to give the yeast enough oxygen to quickly grow and form a stronger fermenting base. Other brewers caution that aeration can oxidize the product and produce off flavors. Most brewers generally agree that aeration during the first week of fermentation is a good idea."}]
23:["$","p","p-32",{"children":"There’s also debate on the importance of yeast nutrition. Laissez-faire brewers will typically be incredibly minimal and rely solely on the honey and raisins to sustain their yeast. More industrial brewers recommend supplying nutrition in staggered intervals over the course of primary fermentation. From what I saw, there’s no clear consensus on what’s “right” here."}]
24:["$","p","p-33",{"children":"I took a fairly naïve and simple approach. Each evening over this past week, I replaced the airlock with a (sterilized) cap, then shook the flask for several minutes before replacing the cap with the (sterilized) airlock. This process also helps release pressure in the must. Every other day, I’ll add in another teaspoon of yeast nutrition then swirl it in to keep the fermentation healthy."}]
