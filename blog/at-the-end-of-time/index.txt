Mangled masses of proteins coalesce between the neurons of the brain, straining and snapping their connections. Alike the buildup of fat in arteries, the process is gradual and devastating. A severed connection here, a strained connection there. At first, redundant connections that don’t impact cognition on a noticeable scale. But the buildup is irreversible and only worsens with time. These are no ordinary proteins. They latch onto one another, and as the body blindly continues to produce them, their tangles continue to grow. They become even more monstrous and intrusive. The body fights back with inflammation and immune responses that only harm the brain further. It is a cruel battle where defeat is inevitable.

All that was, all that is, stored in the hippocampus, a mass of neurons just a few cubic centimeters in volume. Memory is fallible.

If we were to wake up the next morning and forget those we love, those we hate, and everybody in between, would we still be ourselves? If we lose the milestones that define our lives, if we are unable to remember that which makes us who we were, are, and want to be, what meaning is left?

Life settles into local minima, becomes a sea of routine interspersed with islands of spontaneity. One goes months without seeing dear friends, until suddenly, five years have passed and we are strangers in all but name.
