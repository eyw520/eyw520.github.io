My roommate, Hannah, remarked the other day that some of the leaves have started to brown, and she’s right, or so I think. It’s hard to tell, just by looking, but one thing is certain: Fall approaches fast. In a month, on-campus life will resume once again, along with the chaos of classes and activities. In a week, I’ll be back in New York, preparing for the move from coast to coast. The lull of quarantine has begun to fade away, the pace of everyday life picks back up. There’s a palpable excitement within my circles, mixed with threads of anxiety. How exactly will we transition back into an in-person Stanford? How normal will our campus experience truly be? Certainty is a privilege; one Stanford is all too reluctant to grant."}],"\n",["$","p","p-1",{"children":"Seattle has been a wonderful experience. Hannah and I had promised ourselves just that when we’d planned for our stay back in April. Our apartment is beautiful, situated right by the Olympic Sculpture Park and the waterfront, not too far from the downtown offices and nightlife. Our work leaves us ample time to enjoy the city around us. We've enjoyed many of the restaurants all around us, slowly curating our personal favorites. We've went on several hikes, including a trip to Rainier during the alpine bloom. We've taken a trip down to Portland for a day to see the city, a trip that gave us a far greater appreciation for Seattle proper."}],"\n",["$","p","p-2",{"children":"But it’s the people around me that made Seattle so wonderful. Bennett showed me some of my favorite restaurants in the area during our downtown work sessions. Binh and I grabbed brunch several weekends at Portage Bay during our off days. Chloe drove me around to see much of the city beyond the downtown. And in between those adventures were visits from other friends. Andrew visited back in mid-June. Kyle, in early-August. Michelle and Cathy came up from the Bay in mid-August. Despite being two thousand miles from home and eight-hundred miles from Stanford, Seattle still felt remarkably like home."}],"\n",["$","p","p-3",{"children":"My thoughts on the city are positive overall. Seattle is a beautiful city. The skyscrapers are polished to a mirror’s edge, the sidewalks are lined with trees, the streets bustle with life. But the brilliant sheen of downtown masks darker undercurrents. Just blocks away are large lots strewn with tents, occupied by those the city left behind. It’s hard to reconcile just what is and what isn’t natural about Seattle. Whereas SLU and Belltown feel incredibly dependent on the corporate ecosystems around it, Cap Hill, Belltown, and International District all feel like unique, independent sections.
