It’s a quiet Friday afternoon. It’s hot, for Seattle, but 86 is nothing compared to the heat wave coming this weekend. A warm breeze blows in from the bay, carrying with it a reminder of the sea — the faint smell of sea salt, not quite as bold as the Atlantic Ocean spray, but still ever present. Not a single wisp of white floats in the clear blue sky. On a clear day like today, the mountains can be seen rising from the horizon. To my left, Mount Rainier looms large, it’s snowcap glowing a soft pink through the summer haze. To my right, the Olympic mountains sprawl out, their gentle blue ridges almost bleeding into the sky."}],"\n",["$","p","p-1",{"children":"It’s been nearly a month since I left New York. On the 31st of May, I flew out to San Francisco to spend five days in the Bay. Two of those days were spent down on campus, spending time with friends. Some, friends made during my Frosh year, who I hadn’t seen since the pandemic, others, friends made during virtual Stanford, who I met in-person for the first time. Three were spent in San Francisco. I visited SF MOMA after two years away. I was given a local’s tour of the city, courtesy of friends from the area. I saw the sun set over the Pacific for the first time. The latter is etched into my mind. How beautiful it was, to watch the sun slowly descend, the horizon grow gold, then orange, then red, until the bright marble that is the sun disappeared into a scarlet haze."}],"\n",["$","p","p-2",{"children":"Living in Seattle, this beauty has become almost routine. My apartment overlooks Elliot Bay, with a clear view of the Sound. On clear days (which recently there has been an abundance of), I can watch as the Olympic mountains are gilded by the setting sun, cast against clouds blush in jovial pinks. Admittedly, it took me a while to even realize that there were mountains in the distance. My first few days in the city, the Seattle fog hung low over the water, hiding even the nearby hills just opposite the Bay. It was only a few days after I settled in that the fog lifted, revealing the jagged, snowy peaks in the distance. It would be two weeks until I saw Rainier for the first time. Standing at the top of Kerry Park, Rainier juts out above the skyline. It’s still odd for me to see the mountains in the distance. Coming from the East coast, my mountains are spires of grey concrete and twisted steel. Seeing these untamed, nature-formed peaks is humbling."}],"\n","$L13","\n","$L14","\n","$L15"]}],"$L16"]}]}],"$L17"]}]
18:T410,Spring finally gives way to summer and I take my first break after seven consecutive quarters of classes. I look back on virtual Stanford and can’t help but feel somewhat content. As difficult as it, good things have come from quarantine. Being back home allowed me to reconnect with old friends, rekindling friendships that I’d nearly lost in the chaos of frosh year. Being online challenged me to engage more with the communities that matter to me, whether that be dance, a community I’ve now been a part of for two years, or theater, a second family I grew close to just months ago. And despite how stagnant things felt during the online experience, there has been significant change that I’m excited for. I’ll be leading Common Origins through our return to campus, and we’ve begun tentative plans to host the fall show, Breaking Ground. I’ll be guiding the Asian American Issues ASB, which will entail a lot of growth from my end. And I’ll be continuing theater, excitedly watching how theater will re-emerge on campus.13:["$","p","p-3",{"children":"$18"}]
