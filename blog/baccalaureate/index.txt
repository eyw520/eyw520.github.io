That when your friend says there are opportunities to explore Asian American liberation through dance, theater, and service, you dive into all three. That when your neighbor down the hall invites you to take a swim in Lake Lag at 4 AM because it finally stopped raining and they’re surely draining the lake soon, you… maybe sit that one out."}]

Learning is a lifelong process, a state of open-mindedness and eagerness to empathize. Issues that once seemed black and white have given way to rich gradients of viewpoints. Injustices previously painted over by the brush of history invite me to rise up and challenge the systems around me."}]
