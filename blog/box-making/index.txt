It is where my father disappears in the evenings, the source loud whirs and screeches that can be heard from all throughout the house. It is also a wondrous place. When I was younger, I’d venture into the shop, imagining that I was adept enough to shape and craft, pretending that I knew the properties of the wood planks that rested along the walls. As I grew up, the shop shared with us its bounty. A heavy oak desk that forms the centerpiece of my room, a music-stand that I used to practice violin over the years. Shelves, trellises, chairs, chests, and so much more. My father’s works reflect his growth as a hobbyist woodworker. His early works are practical, unadventurous. His more recent works experiment with ingenious contraptions and intricate designs."}],"\n",["$","p","p-1",{"children":"Over the past half year, my father and I talked on and off about me taking some time to learn my way around the tools in the basement, to experiment with some woodworking and gain a greater appreciation for this hobby of his. When I returned home from my junior year at Stanford, we decided to make this a reality. We settled on a simple starting project: a box. My father thinks it’s a great starting point to learn: a box appears simple and unassuming, but there are so many considerations and techniques involved to making a great box. And so, he invites me into his workshop. He will walk me through the design considerations, methods, and procedures. I will learn to use the tools and make the box with my own hands.

The lid will be three-quarters inch tall, and the walls will be a half inch, allowing for the quarter inch hinges with an eighth inch of buffer space on either side. The walls will be joined at 45-degree angles, with reinforcements in the corners. The top and bottom will be set into the sides, inserted into routed grooves that will allow ample room for the wood to expand and contract.

My first cut is slow, but the wood remains largely unburnt, with enough margin to sand off any marks. The second and third cuts are smoother, though small shifts leave the wood with a faint ridge in the middle. We pass the wood through a sander my father designed, specifically made to sand and even out freshly cut planks. After cutting and sanding, the maple plank has been roughly leveled, and all additional work will be done by hand. It is a beautiful plank.

But the sander leaves small ridges in the wood that must be sanded out. We use a hand sander with 150 and 220 grit, sanding for several passes until the wood feels smooth to the touch. We only sand the inside of the box, as it won’t be easily finished after putting together the box walls. In addition to sanding, we make adjustments to the box dimensions and lid. Whereas the original design had dimensions of 5x8 inches, we have enough material to expand the box to 6x8.5. The lid of the box will contain an inlay, and in the center, we’ll use the scroll saw to create a design with purple heart and a deep red hardwood. I am covered in sawdust when I leave the workshop. Sanding is messy business."}]
19:["$","p","p-9",{"children":"Day 4: We think more about the design. We look through sketches curated from my father’s many woodworking books. The one that stands out to me most is a landscape with mountains and a setting sun. Though we initially considered using the scroll saw to carve out shapes from solid wood, my father suggests that marquetry techniques work best. We can use natural wood veneer to form the mountains and dyed wood veneer for the setting sun. We look through samples and settle on a collection of veneer pieces, arranged in a gradient. I sketch the initial pattern. Tomorrow, we aim to construct the box and carve out the marquetry pieces."}]

We use the table saw to carve out a three-eighth inch wide and quarter-inch deep groove on both sides of the plank. Then, we route out a five-eighth inch wide- groove to fit in the inlay. The inlay itself must be cut from a larger piece, shaving off two sixteenth-inch strip from the sides that are joined to form a larger piece.

We move on to the bottom piece, which we create from a three-eighth inch piece of maple. It is slightly curved, so we set the curved side down and cut out enough material to form a tendon that can insert into the grooves of the wall. With the bottom completed, we can perform a dry assemble. We plane out any excess material from the tendon, then insert it into the grooves.

The veneer pieces are joined one at a time, laid atop one another then cut at an angle such that they fit together seamlessly. We work from the left to the right, first the left-most mountains, then the right-most, until at last, the sun and sky are joined together with the mountains to complete the landscape.

First, we cut an inch-wide piece from a larger plank and saw it down to its proper thickness of a nine-sixteenth inch. Then, we cut a small groove for the second inlay, glue it in, and sand until it is flush against the wood. We return to the table saw to cut a groove for the center marquetry piece, and when it is complete, we use a rig to cut the piece into four strips at 45º and glue it all together to form the top.
