Since arriving back at Stanford, I find myself dashing non-stop from classes to projects to work. There is a subtle structure to this chaos. Each day begins and ends with the same two rituals, each lunch and dinner is scheduled for the same fixed times, each assignment is due by the same weekly deadlines. The days blur together. Each week seems near impossible until suddenly, I find myself looking back and wondering how I managed to get through it at all. I am more than halfway through my senior year at Stanford, months away from graduating, and though I may stay a fifth year, I become increasingly aware that my days as a student are numbered. Now, more than ever, I find myself thinking about what kind of life I’d like to build for myself, where I’d like to see myself ten, twenty years down the road.

Back then, it seemed as though I could force time to a crawl just by concentrating hard enough. But as the years have passed, time has also seemed to speed up. Ever-lasting days and never-ending nights now pass by in an instant. Weeks and months that once felt a lifetime now pass faster than I can turn the calendar page. A few days ago, after waking to an early alarm, I spent a few moments watching the second hand sweep its arc from bed. I focused, trying to slow down the clock, fighting against the viscous current of time. For just a fleeting moment, time was still, but then, just as quickly, it passed. The moment was gone, the silence was shattered.

It’s been four years since I started dancing at Stanford. A lifetime ago, it seems, a pre-pandemic world it had been.

Yet the memories of dancing on a new team in a new campus, nervous and alone, still feel so incredibly vivid. I had been eighteen then, and the possibilities of who I could become left me with a sense of wanderlust. An infinite number of possibilities there had been, another infinity that has been lost, narrowed down day by day until arriving at the road that has become my life and the new worlds it brings.

During her six-day isolation period, we met by Lake Lagunita for masked walks by the shore. The lake is a beautiful place; the winter storms have endowed it with a beauty more stunning than anything I could ever imagine. And with the lake a sapphire mirror, wildlife has slowly returned. On our walks together, we saw egrets and vultures, falcons and herons. Oh, and ducks, so many ducks. Four pairs of lovely mallard couples and a lone male, to be exact, all of whom wade in the shallow waters, dipping their heads into the waters and poking their tails to the sky. When I think back on this quarter, those walks stand out so vividly against a backdrop of assignments, commitments, and projects. These were moments of serendipity, when the immediacy of individual obligations fell away to reveal the beauty of the world that we live in.

I am no less ambitious, no less driven, but I begin to recognize the nuanced considerations that must drive my work.

A life of love, of having loved and been loved, of joys, created and indulged, of wonder, constantly pursued and always treasured.
