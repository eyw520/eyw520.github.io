The forecast may predict a week of blue sky one hour and a week of thunderstorms the next. A cloudy day may darken on a moment’s notice and yield a torrent of rainfall, only to fade away into brilliant blue mere minutes after. On occasion, hail falls in defiance of summer.

Then, as the days pass, the clouds grow heavier and heavier, until they seem to almost sag from the sky, the storm within barely held back.
